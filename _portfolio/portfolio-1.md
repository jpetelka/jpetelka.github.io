# tl;dr Summary 
For this project, we conducted two large-scale (> 1000 participants) web-based studies. For each study, I designed and developed novel anti-phishing warnings for email inboxes by drawing on warning science and anti-phishing warning research. I tested these novel warning designs by creating a working inbox that displayed both phishing links and anti-phishing warnings to participants. This inbox recorded participant mouse interactions with hyperlinks (i.e. clicks and hovers) in emails and anti-phishing warnings. 

I evaluated the performance of different warning features, such as placement (where a warning is located), activation method (what user behavior actuates a warning), and hyperlink restrictions (adjusting the clickability of a hyperlink).  Using inferential statistics and regression analyses, I evaluated warning features in terms of click-through rate, or the rate at which people clicked past an anti-phishing warning and travelled to a suspicious website. The results from this work demonstrate that anti-phishing warnings that appear near the suspicious hyperlink are more effective than warnings that appear before the suspicious hyperlink (i.e., in the email's header section) or after clicking a suspicious hyperlink (i.e., a full screen browser warning). In addition, anti-phishing warnings that use some kind of hyperlink restriction (e.g., a short time delay before a hyperlink can be clicked) is most effective at deterring people from clicking on phishing links (Petelka et al, forthcoming).

# Problem Statement
Email continues to be a popular medium for delivering phishing links. Scammers will send emails that encourage potential victims to visit malicious websites by clicking on hyperlinks. To help email readers identify phishing emails, email providers will display anti-phishing warnings either in emails or just before users load a suspicious website.  

## Research Question
How do different anti-phishing warning design features impact warning adherence rates?
