# Summary 
For this project, I designed and developed novel anti-phishing warnings for email inboxes by drawing on warning science. I then developed a working email inbox to test these novel warning designs. I evaluated warning performance primarily in terms of click-through rate, or the rate at which people clicked past an anti-phishing warning and travelled to a suspicious website. I contextualize these results by examining self-reported participant ratings for how intrusive or helpful participants found their warning. The results from this work demonstrate that anti-phishing warnings that appear near the suspicious hyperlink are more effective than warnings that appear before the suspicious hyperlink (i.e., in the email's header section) or after clicking a suspicious hyperlink (i.e., a full screen browser warning). In addition, anti-phishing warnings that use some kind of hyperlink restriction (e.g., a short time delay before a hyperlink can be clicked) is most effective at deterring people from clicking on phishing links (Petelka et al, forthcoming).
