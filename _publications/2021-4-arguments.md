<i><strong>Abstract</strong></i> - Good faith disagreements and healthy conflict management are essential to deliberative democracy and building strong relationships. People increasingly use computer-mediated communication during disagreements,
which raises the question of how technology and design impact users’ disagreements and relationships. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 257 participants to understand how design impacts disagreements across both existing social media platforms and novel, user-generated designs. Through interviews, a survey, and storyboard evaluations, we found that users often want to discuss challenging topics online but avoid them due to fear of hurting their relationships. Further, we found that users are most excited about design interventions that empower collective group action, humanize others online, or support channel switching to more private or socially rich contexts. Our results suggest that although technology has the potential to
support users during conflict, it is also rife with possibilities to do more harm than good by diluting users’ intentions, intruding, or backfiring. We introduce “interpersonal design,” which centers relationships in the design process, an essential step in supporting users in the challenging task of arguing well.
