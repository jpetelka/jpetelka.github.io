<i><strong>Abstract</strong></i> - A digital calculator is one of the most frequently used touch screen applications. However, keypad-based character input in existing calculator applications requires precise, targeted key presses, which is time consuming and error-prone for screen readers users. We introduce <i>GestureCalc</i>, a digital calculator that uses target-free gestures for arithmetic tasks. It allows eyes-free input in the form of taps and directional swipes with one to three fingers, guided by minimal audio feedback, to enter digits and operations. We conducted a mixed methods longitudinal study with eight screen reader users and found that they entered characters with <i>GestureCalc</i> 40.5% faster on average than with a typical touch screen calculator. Participants made more mistakes but also corrected more errors with <i>GestureCalc</i>, resulting in 52.2% fewer erroneous calculations than the baseline. Over the three sessions in the study participants were able to learn the <i>GestureCalc</i> gestures well to efficiently perform short calculations. From our interviews after the second session, participants recognized the effort in learning a new gesture set, yet reported confidence in their ability to become fluent in practice.
